# LEGACY: Manual Release Script for Crawlee Scraper Toolkit
# 
# ‚ö†Ô∏è  DEPRECATED: This script is kept for emergency situations only.
# The recommended way to release is using semantic-release via CI/CD:
# 
# 1. Create a PR with conventional commits
# 2. Merge to main branch 
# 3. CI/CD will automatically handle the release
#
# For manual release, use: pnpm run release:dry (to preview) or pnpm run release
